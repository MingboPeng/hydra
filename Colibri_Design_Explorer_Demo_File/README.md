### Description 
This is an example file that generates a similar study to Design Explorer's default demo.
This study includes basic daylighting and energy simulations.

The test office zone is modeled by following variables: room depth, room height, window to wall ratio, orientation, and number of shades. Outputs are: sDA, DA, CDA, UDI, Cooling, Heating. Be aware, there are 972 iterations in total, and this will take hours to days if you release the Colibri without changing any inputs.

To understand this file, you need to have 
a basic knowledge of Daylighting and Energy simulations in Honeybee. You should also be familar with Colibri, if not, please check the basic tutorial: http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=MingboPeng&fork=hydra&id=Colibri_Basic_Design_Explorer&slide=0&scale=1&offset=0,0
